#Notice anything new in our .gitignore? There are actually multiple .gitignore files in this project, can you find them all?
We have two new "Yarn" messages now. We have two .gitignore files in this lab; one in the server directory and the other one in the client directory.

#Note also that there are now multiple build.gradle files as well! Why is this?
We have two build.gradle files; because the program for this lab is separated into two directories, the server side and the client side.

#What are a couple of these new tools? Explain what some of these new tools do?
Angular, jquery, typescript, and webpack.
**Add explanation later

#How does the navbar work in this project? Is our SparkJava server the only thing doing routing?
navbar creates a navigation bar on the client side. In this lab we also have `app.routes.js` that does routing.

#What does the user-list.service.ts do? Why is it not just done in the user-list.component.ts?
